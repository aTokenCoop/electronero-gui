init, notes;

Parallell daemon will introduce multiple daemon functionality to the GUI. 
-Offerring multi-coin storages
-Compile time builds multi-daemon
-Runtime runs specific daemon
-Wallet storage is aware, and COIN-A wallet is not opened on COIN-B network even if WALLET-A and WALLET-B exist on COIN-A and COIN-B network, the cache store is not going to match in any case.
-RPC switches port based on COIN
-Wallet cache switches based on COIN

Done:
-User selection drop down | for remote node on Settings Panel interior of GUI
-User selection drop down | for COIN on Daemon Settings panel before entering wallet
